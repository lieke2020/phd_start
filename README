runner.py
---------
The main entry point for simulatons: this file implements functions to train agents on the task until they have converged.

tasks.py
--------
This file implements the four environments that constitute 'tasks' for WorkMATe agents to learn.

inputs.py
---------
This file specifies the mapping between the inputs offered in different tasks, and their vector representation  that can be processed by a neural network.

workmate.py
-----------
This file contains a class that defines the WorkMATe agent, how it processes stimuli on a trial and how it learns.

workmate_PG.py
--------------
This file implements a specific type of WorkMATe agent that can be used on the Pro-/Antisaccade task. In the article, this version is used to illustrate the added complexity of learning a gating policy. This version of WorkMATe uses a prespecified set of gating actions that are not affected by learning.
